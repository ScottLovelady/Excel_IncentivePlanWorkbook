# Creating a tiered incentive plan workbook for Account Executives and Sales Managers. 
# Able to handle commission percentage tiers, tier bonuses, supplemental or advance bonuses, +other stuff
# May rewrite to use SUMPRODUCT instead of VLOOKUP for commission tiers, 
#    but this works for now. It isn't as concise but it is easier to explain to non-technical people
